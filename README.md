## Welcome to FinQlonAI

An AI financial data and analytics API built for developers. 

## 🎯Mission:
    Current competitors charge way too much for the financial and data analysis you need (Ahem Bloomberg). At FinQlonAI we aim       to be:

    Intelligent: Because you need AI analysis as a priority, not raw data
    Fast: Because you need to be real-time to have an advantage
    Affordable: Because you shouldn't be paying the cost of a car every year
    Developer-first: Because we care about your experience
